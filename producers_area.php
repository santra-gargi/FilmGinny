                <p>The implausible escape of a brilliant murderess brings U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to Ashecliffe Hospital, a fortress-like insane asylum located on a remote, windswept island. The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls. As the investigation deepens, Teddy realizes he will have to confront his own dark fears if he hopes to make it off the island alive.</p>

                <p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal
                    their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of
                    corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when
                    he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will
                    be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</p>

                <p>In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm.
                    By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together
                    with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune
                    by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a
                    hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess.</p>
